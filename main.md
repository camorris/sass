# **SASS UNDERSTANDING**


## Objective 

This file serves to show my knowledge of

_1. CSS3_  
_2. SASS_

## Why? 
I enjoy learning different web technologies made for Developers and UX Designers. Being able to productively manipulate html elements to show a aesthetically pleasing UI, helps solve problems. I 100% agree that the functionality of the UI comes FIRST. However, when something is visually appealing you can improve your chances of increasing a business's Web Traffic and Conversion Rate while lowering the Bounce Rate. This ultimately means a higher probability of accomplishing specific goals .

## When?
Often times the reason to use SASS as oppose to just straight CSS, is higher productivity. Created by Hampton Catlin and Natalie Weizenbaum this preprocessor scripting language ( input data to produce output that is used as input to another program) should be used when you want to extend the ability and simplicity of how the UI looks.
